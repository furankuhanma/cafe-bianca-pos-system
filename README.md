# Coffee Shop Order Management System

## Problem
Many small coffee shops still rely on manual order tracking or basic POS systems that make it hard to manage order queues, track transactions, and review sales performance efficiently. This often leads to slow service, lost orders, and poor visibility into daily operations.

## Solution
This project provides a simple order management system for coffee shops that helps handle order queues efficiently, record every transaction, and track all orders in one place. It streamlines the ordering process while giving shop owners clear insights into sales and order history.

## Who Is This For?
- Coffee shop owners who want better control and visibility over their operations  
- Cashiers who need a fast and simple way to take and manage orders  

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The MVP focuses on the core functionality needed to run daily coffee shop operations:

- Display available products
- Create and record customer orders
- Save orders to order history
- View basic analytics (e.g. total orders, sales summary)
